### Task 2: Using lists and dictionaries; Automate repeating tasks using Python “for” loops.
#### Step 1: Practice with lists (including converting list to pd.Series).
#### Step 2: Practice with dictionaries.
#### Step 3: Practice with "for" loop examples.
#### Step 4: Practice Steps 1-4 in exercise with worldbank_immunization.csv. Task: Display percentage of children vaccinated against measles for each country in 2017 only.
